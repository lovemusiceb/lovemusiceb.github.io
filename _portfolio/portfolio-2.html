title: "Overview of our DRDM model for person image composition"
excerpt: "(a) DRDM consists of the BSDB, pose encoder $E_{p}$, and noise prediction block $\mathcal{H}_{N}$.(b) We design a disentangled classifier-free guided sampling, which amplifies the conditional signals of texture and pose based on parsing map, ensuring a close alignment between the appearance of the generated person image and the target pose. <br/><img src='/images/drdm.png'>"
