title: "MVSN: A Multi-view Stack Network for Human Parsing"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/number-3
excerpt: 'The human parsing task involves assigning detailed pixel-level labels, but existing methods struggle with issues like ambiguous boundaries and incomplete parts. To address this, we propose the Multi-view Stack Network (MVSN), which uses three feature stacks (body parts, edges, and pre-segmentation) and a channel correlator to improve the integration of local and global information. Experiments on public datasets show that MVSN outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.'
