excerpt: 'Researches on human parsing methods have attracted increasing attention in a wide range of applications. However, dataset imbalance is still a challenging problem in this task, which directly affects the performance of human parsing. There are different types of dataset imbalance problems. For example, the numbers of samples for various labels in a dataset may differ, the scales of objects identified by different labels may vary considerably, the differences between some heterogeneous label types may be much smaller than other cases, and in some extreme situations, images may be labeled incorrectly. In this paper, we propose a rebalanced model for imbalanced human parsing.'
