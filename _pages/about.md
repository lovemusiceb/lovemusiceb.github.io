I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Sun Yat-sen University, specializing in human parsing, person image composition, and operating systems. Currently, I serve as a lecturer at the School of Computer Science and Information Engineering at Nanning Normal University, where I am dedicated to teaching and advancing research in my field.

Human Parsing
======
Human parsing, which aims at decomposing a human-centric image into the regions of semantic parts, is a challenging dense prediction task. Meanwhile, it is a useful technology in many image processing and information retrieval tasks.

Person Image Synthesis
=======
Person image synthesis with controllable body poses and appearances is an essential and widely applicable task with enormous potential in various fields, including virtual try-on, image editing, video production, and person re-identification. 
The goal of this task is to explicitly manipulate the body posture and appearance of the source individual picture, generating a photo-realistic person image that aligns with user expectations

Operating System
=======
An Operating System (OS) is system software that manages hardware resources and provides essential services for computer programs, acting as an intermediary between users and the machine. It handles tasks like process scheduling, memory management, file system organization, and I/O operations to ensure efficient and secure system functionality.
